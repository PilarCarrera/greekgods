      <h2>Who is Poseidon?</h2>
      <p>
        Poseidon is one of the three great brothers who divided the cosmos, becoming ruler of the sea. He commands waves, storms, and sea creatures, and sailors prayed to him for safe passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is also known as the Earth-Shaker because of his power over earthquakes. In myth, his temper can be swift and destructive, but he is also a creator and patron of horses.
