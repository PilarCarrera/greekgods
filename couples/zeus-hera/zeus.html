      <h2>Who is Zeus?</h2>
      <p>
        Zeus is the supreme god in Greek mythology and the ruler of Mount Olympus. He controls the sky, thunder, and lightning, and is often depicted holding a powerful lightning bolt. As king of the gods, Zeus maintains order among both gods and humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is the youngest son of Cronus and Rhea. After defeating his father and the Titans, Zeus and his siblings divided the universe: Zeus took the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld.
